        h1  VIA Journey - Product Proposal
        p As Canada’s only provider of coast-to-coast passenger rail service, VIA Rail is Canada’s equivalent of a national passenger train. VIA Rail’s primary revenue stream comes from its local commuter services, with its highly rated long-distance tourism trains struggling in sales.
        p VIA Journey is our digital solution to VIA Rail’s declining ridership and brand misperception, inviting first-time potential passengers to reassess the value proposition VIA Rail offers. VIA Journey presents train travel as an alternative and enjoyable form of transportation tourism, aligning VIA Rail’s value proposition alongside consumers’ tangible, intangible, and aspirational values.

            p While the Canadian tourism industry has been experiencing a growth in demand, VIA Rail is struggling and has lost $8 million in tourism. 
          div(class="left")

          div(class="right")
            p Our initial assumptions led us to incorrectly believe that VIA Rail was unappealing due to higher prices, longer travel times, and cramped spaces. It took extensive user research to correct this assumption.

          h3 Insights: User &amp; Brand Relationship 
          p These user interviews helped place our secondary research in context, and revealed a number of insights that corrected our assumptions:
          ol
            li Airlines aren't a direct competitor of VIA Rail, as VIA Rail offers more than just transportation 
            li VIA Rail's higher prices can be broken down as a hotel room, dining, and transportation. 
            li Previous painpoints we assumed existed were actually reported as insignificant
            li VIA Rail's current website actually fails to distinguish its tourism products from its commuter products

          p With these insights, we saw an opportunity for a design intervention that would address VIA Rail’s business problem. VIA Rail’s current website is ineffective at enticing consumers, and potential passengers weren’t discovering the value of their excellent onboard experience.
          p With VIA Rail’s Destination 2025 vision, VIA Rail identified four key values to guide their organizational strategy. With Connectivity, VIA Rail seeks to “…create innovative solutions and ideas to connect our passengers, employees, and assets”. We’ve chosen to push this definition further, utilizing Connectivity as the journey being as valuable as the destination as an opportunity to realign their value proposition such that VIA Rail would be considered a desirable option for tourism.

These individuals would be fairly flexible with their travel plans, and be open to sharing new experiences with strangers.

          p Moving into a specific route from the homepage, potential passengers are presented with specific scenes from that journey. Each scene is revealed through the customer’s every scroll, breaking down and mapping the physical journey into a series of digital interactions.
          p Combined with animations, our solution creates layers of information. Overall, this reduces the cognitive overhead by affording customers the ability to understand the journey at their own pace.
          p The intended effect this has on VIA Rail’s perceived value is that the presented landscapes and cities become a tangible value; a promise of what customers will receive, with stories and images to reinforce that journey is the key value of the trip.

          p These posts provide credibility to VIA Rail; showing that other passengers have enjoyed VIA Rail’s journey-based experience. Using geo-hashtags to chunk this content further reduces cognitive effort while highlighting the intangible value promised: to show potential passengers what they might do on this journey.

          p Scrolling down, the site cognitively front-loads our three class options. Hovering over each reveals an immediate tangible value, and clicking explore triggers more information to fill the frame, consistent with the thematic use of the long scroll and layered information.
          p We recognize that we can’t design one set of higher values to appeal to all customers, and we leveraged their price points and distinct classes to better target different types of customers. Instead of trying to appeal to the cost-conscious consumer with the premium offerings, we guide customers down their corresponding classes, tailoring the activities and accommodations that best fulfills their intangible and aspirational needs.

          p Finally, after exploring the breadth of information available for the selected route, we wanted to propose the next steps: options for the consumer to book a journey or explore other routes. The intention of this is to provide both a hard and soft commitment; consumers can choose to make the purchasing decision, or continue exploring.

          p VIA Journey represented my first user experience project, and was where I was introduced to Sprints and the jungle of mental models present in Newbery &amp; Farnham's Experience Design book. The greatest surprise to me was how heavily involved business thinking and strategy was at the core of this project. I found myself comfortably explaining business decisions to my team members, switching back and forth between design and business contexts. 
      div(class="full")
        h3 Impact 
        p We believe that VIA Journey better entices potential passengers to consider VIA Rail as a viable option for transportation tourism, through addressing painpoints on the original site as well as realigning VIA Rail's perceived value proposition with their intended one. Looking forward, I'd want to address accessibility concerns as well as rethinking how VIA Journey would appear on different devices.  
        p VIA Journey went on to being selected by Chelsea Garber from Inamoto &amp; Co. as one of the two winning projects of the term, with our team being selected for an opportunity to be mentored by Chelsea on a brief from Inamoto' &amp; Co's client Toyota.

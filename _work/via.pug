          h2 VIA Journey - Product Proposal
          p As Canada’s only provider of coast-to-coast passenger rail service, VIA Rail is Canada’s equivalent of a national passenger train. VIA Rail’s primary revenue stream comes from its local commuter services, with its highly rated long-distance tourism trains struggling in sales.  
          p VIA Journey is our digital solution to VIA Rail’s declining ridership and brand misperception, inviting first-time potential passengers to reassess the value proposition VIA Rail offers. VIA Journey presents train travel as an alternative and enjoyable form of transportation tourism, aligning VIA Rail’s value proposition alongside consumers’ tangible, intangible, and aspirational values.

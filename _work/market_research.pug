          h2 Market Watch: Research + Analysis
          p In Q1 2017, I conducted market research on NCIX PC's competitors across North America. My research covered 16 high-priority companies and over 500 products, and I presented my analysis on competitors' changing products, prices, and strategies. Crucially, I provided business recommendations and actionables on how NCIX PC could evolve its product strategy as a response to North America's changing retail landscape.

          ul
            li provided an updated view on current market conditions
            li quantified a growing threat in the behavior of NCIX PC's competitors
            li as a response to this new threat, used the documented behavior of larger competitors to proposed a new product strategy for NCIX PC, which was later implemented

NCIX PC (and its parent company, NCIX) competed in both channels, having had both a general retail arm and boutique SI division.

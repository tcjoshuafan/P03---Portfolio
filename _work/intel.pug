        h1  Intel Extreme Rig Challenge 2017
        p Every year, Intel partners with custom PC system integrators to host the Intel Extreme Rig Challenge. Companies such as Cyberpower PC and Maingear are tasked with building insane computers with a $10,000 USD budget, and the public votes on the top systems through Twitter campaigns.
        p This contest brings immense exposure to all companies involved, showcasing the skills of each builder while simultaneously providing an opportunity for component brands (ASUS, Corsair, etc) to demonstrate their products. Combined with the large marketing development funds (MDF) contributed by partners, the IER Challenge is a massive marketing campaign that culminates in a three-day public exhibition at PAX East 2017.
